# wysper-client
Client application for the Wysper messaging service

## Initial setup!

First clone the repo into intellij.
1. New project -> from existing source -> from version control

When you get your project running:
1. Right click on the top level directory (wysper-client for me)
2. At the bottom, go to mark as -> sources root

Next:
Go to File -> Project Structure -> and make sure your sdk level is set to 1.8.
Also make sure your java level is set to 8.
Finally, in project structure make sure your terminal output is set to some location.

Now try and run the basicServer file. You should see terminal output.

If at any point you have trouble, google the exact error message and you may be able to quickly find a solution.
